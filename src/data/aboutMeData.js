		bio: 'Clinical interests and specialties: Anxiety/panic/phobias, depression, relationships and attachment, trauma, sexuality, identity issues, life transition. I\'ve worn many hats in the career space, from digital marketing, teaching English as a second language, and volunteering as a court appointed special advocate for a foster youth. Most recently, I provided brief therapy to college students as a trainee psychotherapist before beginning my journey at Lomi! I love to travel. I lived in Italy twice and have seen a fair share of the U.S. I also enjoy a classic trip to the movies, or trying a new pasta dish.',
